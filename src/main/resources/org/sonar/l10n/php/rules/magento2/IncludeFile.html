<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>This rule detects possible improper usage of include and require functions in PHP.</p>

<h3>Noncompliant Code Example</h3>
<pre>
// Noncompliant: URL in include
include("https://example.com/script.php");

// Noncompliant: String concatenation
include($base_dir . "/file.php");

// Noncompliant: Variable usage
include($filename);
</pre>


<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>File inclusion vulnerabilities occur when a web application dynamically includes external files based on user-controlled input. This can lead to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remote code execution vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Information disclosure vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Using variables or string concatenation with include/require functions can be dangerous if user input is not properly sanitized.</p>
