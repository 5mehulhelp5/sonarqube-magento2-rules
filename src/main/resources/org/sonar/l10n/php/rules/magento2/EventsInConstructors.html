<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
    In Magento 2, triggering events within constructors is considered a bad practice.
    When events are dispatched during object construction, it can lead to unpredictable behavior, potential dependency cycles and
    Performance degradation during object initialization
</p>

<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
    public function __construct($fileReader, $eventManager)
    {
        $this->data = $fileReader->read('cache.xml');
        $eventManager->dispatch('config_read_after'); // Noncompliant
    }

</pre>
