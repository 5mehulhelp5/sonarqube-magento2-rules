<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Magento is a highly extensible and customizable platform. The use of <code>final</code> classes and methods is prohibited as it prevents extension and customization.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
final class MyClass // Noncompliant
{
    public function someMethod()
    {
        ...
    }
}

class AnotherClass
{
    final public function finalMethod() // Noncompliant
    {
        ...
    }
}
    </pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class MyClass // Compliant
{
    public function someMethod()
    {
       ...
    }
}

class AnotherClass
{
    public function method() // Compliant
    {
        ...
    }
}
    </pre>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<p>The <code>final</code> keyword prevents classes from being extended and methods from being overridden. In Magento:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extensibility is a core principle that allows merchants and developers to customize the platform to their needs</li>
    <li>Plugins (interceptors) cannot work with final methods</li>
    <li>Proxy generation fails with final classes</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection becomes more difficult with final implementations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>There are generally no exceptions to this rule in Magento development. Even if a class or method is not intended to be extended, it should not be marked as final to maintain compatibility with Magento's extensibility mechanisms.</p>
